# Dataflow Batch Demo

## Background

The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate the Dataflowâ€™s batch capability. It references TTC delay data stored on Google Cloud Storage that has been reformatted and converted to CSV prior to Dataflow ingestion.  Dataflow will produce the necessary ETL processes on each data source, collect the data as one bundle, and create a BigQuery table. 

### TTC Delay Data
